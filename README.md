# ShadowRun-App
Interactive app to explore the ShadowRun universe.

A full-stack app built with Flask for the backend and a vanilla JS front end. Users provide some personal data, and in return, they receive an associated ShadowRun character. The application then fetches interesting facts about that NPC and their role in the ShadowRun universe, providing a unique and engaging experience.
